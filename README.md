This project is a demo of the sea battle game.
The code is specially complicated and looks like a freak written in objective C, 
since I just switched to swift and started 
learning classes. I wanted to go through all the circles of hell in this language.
The project implemented a random appearance of ships on the field with all the checks,
Also shooting at them using coordinates.
The fewer attempts will be spent to kill all the ships, the better the result will be.
